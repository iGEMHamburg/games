         "intro": "Hello and welcome to the Antibiotic Resistance Game by the iGEM Team Hamburg 2023. We are excited to welcome you to the world of bacteria and antibiotics!\n\nBefore we dive into battling bacteria, let us introduce ourselves:\n\nWe are a team of 15 students from Hamburg, Germany participating in the largest international competition for synthetic biology, the iGEM competition. iGEM stands for the \"International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition.\"\n\nWe are competing against more than 400 teams from over 40 countries. Despite the term \"competition\", we are not fighting against each other, but rather together. We are all fighting for a better world, using synthetic biology as our weapon.\n\nIf you haven't heard about synthetic biology before, no problem! We will still have fun together, and we'll tell you everything you need to know, so don't worry.\n\nWe will reveal more about the project we are working on during the course of the game. Just a little preview: we want to eliminate harmful bacteria. This is not a new idea in itself – there are already antibiotics which we can use to do so. However, harmful bacteria developed defense mechanisms against antibiotics, effectively outsmarting them. These defense mechanisms are called resistances and pose a significant problem. We have come up with something to overcome these defense mechanisms and fight the harmful bacteria.\n\nBut enough about us, let's talk about you now!\n\nWe want to team up with you to take down harmful bacteria (single-celled organisms). We will explore how bacteria can protect themselves and what the field of science has already done to counteract these defense mechanisms.",
         "lets_go": "So, to the bacteria, get set, go!\n\nLet's take them down!",
         "story_title": "In a cheerful mood, you enter your workplace building and are approached by a colleague.",
         "story_1": "She says, \"Thank goodness you're here! A dangerous bacterium is roaming around, causing many people to fall seriously ill. The hospitals are overflowing, and the doctors are helpless. This bacterium is persistent. It seems unbeatable.\"\n\nYou hold a different opinion, saying, \"I can handle this bacterium just fine.\" After all, you're not just any scientist – you're an expert in your field. You put on your lab coat. If you have long hair, you tie it up, and off you go to the lab, your workspace. In the lab, you find all the materials and equipment you need to combat the bacteria.\n\nYou quickly review the basics of bacteria in your mind:\n\nBacteria aren't all the same: there are differences among them. We have bacteria in and on our own bodies that help us stay healthy. These bacteria are the ones you want to protect, not destroy with antibiotics.\n\nThen, there are harmful or dangerous bacteria that make us sick. They can invade our bodies and trigger severe infections. Those bacteria are your target. You want to annihilate them.\n\nAdditionally, you bring the image of a bacterium to mind:",
         "story_2": "It has an outer shell (cell wall) and many smaller components inside. Their task is it to supply the bacterium with energy and facilitate its reproduction. Additionally, you're continually fascinated by the fact that bacteria are the oldest forms of life on our planet.\n\nHowever, you also know that bacteria can be defeated. Antibiotics are a good and proven weapon against these single-celled organisms. Antibiotics can penetrate the bacteria's cell wall or disrupt the processes within the cell, causing the bacteria to die. You're also aware that bacteria have developed defense mechanisms to protect themselves against the attack of antibiotics. \"Those annoying resistances,\" you think to yourself. Bacteria should really not be underestimated!\n\nYour team has gathered around you. All of you are ready to face this single-celled organism as a team and work together to find a solution. So, you all get started and examine the harmful bacterium before you.",

Be cautious, as the bacterium might mutate and evolve during the game!\n\nCarefully read through the set of cards and choose an appropriate one to efficiently combat the bacterium.\n\nThe bacterium's goal is to: Stay alive.\n\nThe science's goal is to: Render the Bacterium harmless!",
